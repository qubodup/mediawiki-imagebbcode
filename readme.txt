An extension to display BBCode embedding code on MediaWiki "Image"-namespace pages.

== Installation ==

1. Copy the 'ImageBBCode' directory to the 'extensions' directory
2. Add 'require_once("$IP/extensions/ImageBBCode/ImageBBCode.php");' to your LocalSettings.php

== About ==

Made with game projects in mind (in particular DungeonHack <http://dungeonhack.sf.net> and PARPG <http://parpg.net>), who want to use their MediaWiki installation to keep their concept art or other images. The extension makes it easier to show uploaded images on the forum by skipping some BBCode writing.

Inspired by Flickr <http://flickr.com> and Flickr BBcode Tool <http://www.fatreg.net/flickrtools/flickr-bbcode.html>
